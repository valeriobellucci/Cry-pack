- bragg_shift_o is almost the same as bragg_shift_os, which is almost the same as bragg_shift_hs, lot or repetition in general
- sometimes denumerator, sometimes denominator
- global variables
- darwin_oc, darwin_os could be realized by one function and keyword parameter
  grazing_correction=True|False
- unused functions, e.g. A_crystal_symmetric, etc.
- function names should be verbs, e.g. reflectivity_entrance -> compute_entrance_reflectivity, or use classes and properties instead
- use the quantities package, no arcsec function required
- convert material to a class and all the functions which use it to its methods and properties, e.g. the density function
